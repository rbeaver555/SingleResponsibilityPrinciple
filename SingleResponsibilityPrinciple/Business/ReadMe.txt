The business layer is specifically for that code that contains pure business logic. Examples of that might be:

1. Calculating a commission rate
2. Determining how many bedrooms a public housing recipient qualifies for
3. The depreciation of an asset

Use this layer to cleanly separate business logic from the rest of your solution.
